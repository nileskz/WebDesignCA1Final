      <p>
        A group of fifteen volunteers met at the local stream last weekend to
        remove rubbish from the riverbank. Within a few hours, they filled more
        than ten large bags with plastic bottles, cans and other waste. Clean-up
        events like this keep the water cleaner and improve the area for both
        wildlife and local residents.

      <p>
        Recent tests were carried out on three community wells. Two wells stayed
        within safe levels for non-drinking uses such as washing and gardening.
        One well showed slightly cloudy water, so it has been marked for further
        cleaning and follow-up testing. Regular checks like these help identify
        issues early and reduce health risks.
